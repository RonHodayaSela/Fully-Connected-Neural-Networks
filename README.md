**README for Text Classification Assignment**
*This project was done as part of the academic studies
Overview
In this assignment, you will predict labels for text documents using a fully connected neural network. You will train your model on a provided training dataset and evaluate it on a validation set, ultimately applying it to a test set.

Define a Neural Network:

Use Keras to build a fully connected neural network.
First layer size should match your input vectors.
Use ReLU activation for hidden layers and sigmoid for the output.
Loss: binary_crossentropy; Metric: accuracy.
Architecture (number of layers, batch size, epochs) is flexible.
Predict and Save Results: Run the model on the test data and save predictions in CSV format.
